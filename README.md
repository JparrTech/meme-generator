# React Meme Generator

I created a meme generator with input fields for top text and bottom text. When the fields are filled out and the button is pressed, the meme generator gets to work and added the text to the image. 

In building this project I learned:
* How to create controlled components with onChange to update state with every change made to the input field. 
* Functional Programming: Keeping React Components "pure" by using the React Hook UseEffect.
